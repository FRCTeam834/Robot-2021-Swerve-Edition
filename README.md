# Robot 2021 Swerve Edition

![Build](https://github.com/FRCTeam834/Robot-2021-Swerve-Edition/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

A rewrite of the 2021 robot code, using SwerveBase as a starting point

## Terminology note

SwerveBase code uses the word "angle" to describe the angle of the pivot of the module in degrees. It also uses "velocity" to describe the speed of the wheel in m/s (meters per second). Speed, RPM, or radians should not be used.
